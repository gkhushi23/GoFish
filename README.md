Go Fish Game ðŸŽ´

A command-line implementation of the classic card game Go Fish, written in Java. This project showcases object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, making it a great example for learning and practicing Java development.

Introduction

The Go Fish card game is a simple yet strategic game where players aim to collect sets of four cards of the same rank. This project simulates a two-player version of the game, focusing on the core gameplay mechanics.


Features

Two-player gameplay.
Card deck initialization with shuffling.
Players can:
Ask for a card rank from the opponent.
Draw a card if the opponent doesn't have the requested rank.
Complete sets and track scores.
Dynamic turn-based gameplay with automatic winner determination.
How to Play
Each player is dealt 7 cards at the start.
Players take turns asking the opponent for a specific card rank.
If the opponent has the requested rank:
The opponent gives all cards of that rank to the requesting player.
If the opponent does not have the requested rank:
The player must "Go Fish" and draw a card from the deck.
Players complete sets by collecting four cards of the same rank.
The game ends when:
The deck is empty, or
All sets are completed.
The player with the most completed sets wins!
